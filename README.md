- **Right Joystick (Orange)** - Look around/camera control
- **D/I/P Buttons** - Activate Disruptor/Immobilizer/Pacifier devices
- **Swipe Left/Right** - Quick device switching
- **Tap Game Area** - Activate current device
- **‚öôÔ∏è Settings Icon** - Access configuration and sensitivity controls

## Development

### Testing
```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

Unit tests cover maze generation, player mechanics, device systems, and architectural integrity using Vitest with jsdom.

### Architecture
The game uses a modular event-driven architecture with:
- **Centralized Configuration** (`GameConfig.js`) for all game constants
- **State Management** (`GameState.js`) for game lifecycle
- **Event System** (`EventManager.js`) for decoupled module communication
- **Rendering Pipeline** split between raycasting (`RaycastRenderer.js`) and sprite rendering (`SpriteRenderer.js`)
- **Difficulty System** (`DifficultyConfig.js`) for dynamic difficulty scaling
- **Share System** (`ShareManager.js`, `ChallengeManager.js`, `MazeEncoder.js`) for challenge sharing
- **Touch System** (`TouchManager.js`, `VirtualJoystick.js`, `TouchHUD.js`) for mobile controls
- **Platform Detection** (`PlatformDetector.js`) for device-specific optimizations
- **Internationalization** (`I18nManager.js`) for multi-language support

### Performance
- Ray marching optimized for quality/performance balance
- Particle system capped at 200 particles
- Simplified billboards instead of complex 3D models
- Procedural maze generation typically completes under 200ms

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Requires:
- ES6 module support
- Canvas 2D rendering context
- Pointer Lock API (for mouse look)
- Performance API (for timing)

## Touch Screen Support

CalmMaze FPS features comprehensive touch screen support for mobile and tablet devices:

### Features
- **Dual Joystick System** - Separate movement (left, cyan) and look (right, orange) controls
- **Touch-Friendly Device Buttons** - Large D/I/P buttons for defense system activation
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-optimized HUD with adaptive layouts
- **Platform Detection** - Automatic mobile/tablet detection with optimized UI
- **Configurable Sensitivity** - Customizable joystick and look sensitivity settings
- **Cross-Platform** - Works alongside desktop controls without conflicts

### Architecture
- **TouchManager** - Touch capability detection and event handling
- **VirtualJoystick** - Configurable joystick components with visual themes
- **TouchHUD** - Complete dual joystick interface integration
- **EventManager** - Unified input processing for touch and traditional inputs

### Testing
Touch support is validated through comprehensive unit tests and an interactive browser test suite (`touch-test.html`) for real device validation.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Multi-language support with automatic language detection and seamless switching:

### Supported Languages
- **English** üá∫üá∏ (Default)

Access language settings through the configuration panel (‚öôÔ∏è gear icon).

## Difficulty System

Comprehensive difficulty configuration with dynamic presets and custom tuning:

### Difficulty Presets
- **Teen-Safe** - Minimal challenge, quick completion (5x5 maze, 0 enemies)
- **Easy** - Relaxed pace with generous resources (10x10 maze, 3 enemies)
- **Normal** - Balanced challenge for most players (15x15 maze, 5 enemies)
- **Hard** - Challenging maze with limited resources (20x20 maze, 8 enemies)
- **Custom** - Fully customizable settings for personalized difficulty

### Customizable Parameters
- **Maze Size** - From 5√ó5 to 50√ó50 cells
- **Enemy Count** - 0 to 20 friendly creatures
- **Enemy Speed** - From slow (0.5x) to insane (2.0x)
- **Time Limit** - Dynamically calculated based on maze complexity
- **Device Charges** - Adjust starting charges for each defense device
- **Recharge Pads** - Configure number of recharge stations

### Difficulty Rating
Each configuration receives a calculated difficulty rating (1-10) based on maze complexity, enemy count/speed, and available resources.

## Challenge Sharing

Share your maze completions with friends via shareable URLs:

### Features
- **URL Encoding** - Maze configuration and target time encoded in compact URLs
- **Challenge Mode** - Play shared mazes with target time to beat
- **Victory Sharing** - Share your victories when beating challenge times
- **Persistent Challenges** - Challenges work across sessions via URL parameters

### How to Share
1. Complete a maze
2. Press **S** or click the **Share Challenge** button
3. Copy the generated URL or use native sharing
4. Share with friends to challenge them to beat your time!

### Testing
Interactive test pages are included for development:
- `touch-test.html` - Touch screen controls validation
- `dual-joystick-test.html` - Dual joystick system testing
- `share-test.html` - Challenge sharing functionality testing
