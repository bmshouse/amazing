## Development

### Testing
```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

Unit tests cover maze generation, player mechanics, device systems, and architectural integrity using Vitest with jsdom.

### Architecture
The game uses a modular event-driven architecture with:
- **Centralized Configuration** (`GameConfig.js`) for all game constants
- **State Management** (`GameState.js`) for game lifecycle
- **Event System** (`EventManager.js`) for decoupled module communication
- **Hybrid Rendering Pipeline**:
  - `RaycastRenderer.js` - 2D raycasting for walls with textured surfaces
  - `SpriteRenderer.js` - Billboard sprite rendering for 2D entities and particles
  - `Model3DRenderer.js` - WebGL/Three.js renderer for 3D enemy models with LOD system
- **Difficulty System** (`DifficultyConfig.js`) for dynamic difficulty scaling
- **Share System** (`ShareManager.js`, `ChallengeManager.js`, `MazeEncoder.js`) for challenge sharing
- **Touch System** (`TouchManager.js`, `VirtualJoystick.js`, `TouchHUD.js`, `TouchGestureDetector.js`) for mobile controls
- **Platform Detection** (`PlatformDetector.js`) for device-specific optimizations
- **Internationalization** (`I18nManager.js`) for multi-language support
- **Settings Persistence** (localStorage) for user preferences across sessions

### Performance
- Ray marching optimized for quality/performance balance
- Particle system capped at 200 particles
- LOD system for 3D models with distance-based detail switching
- Automatic fallback to 2D sprites for distant or occluded enemies
- WebGL capability detection with graceful degradation
- Procedural maze generation typically completes under 200ms
- 60 FPS target with automatic performance monitoring
