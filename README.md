# CalmMaze FPS

A browser-based 3D maze game built with vanilla JavaScript and raycasting. Navigate procedurally generated mazes using classic FPS controls while avoiding friendly creatures that apply stunning effects instead of damage.

## Quick Start

1. **Download** or clone this repository
2. **Open `index.html`** in any modern browser
3. **Click the canvas** to enter pointer lock mode
4. **Use WASD** to move and **mouse** to look around
5. **Find the green exit door** to complete the maze

No installation, build step, or server required!

## Features

### Technical Highlights
- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or dependencies for the game engine
- **Raycasting 3D Renderer** - Real-time 3D world rendering using classic raycasting techniques
- **Procedural Maze Generation** - Infinite variety using recursive backtracking algorithm
- **Optimized Performance** - Internal low-res buffer upscaled for 60 FPS on mid-range devices
- **Modular Architecture** - 17 clean ES6 modules with event-driven design

### Gameplay
- **Three Device Types** - Disruptor (short range), Immobilizer (projectile), Pacifier (precise)
- **Smart Enemy AI** - Pathfinding creatures that gently push you back when touched
- **Recharge Pads** - Blue circular stations that refill all device charges
- **Teen-Safe Design** - No violence or damage, just friendly stunning effects
- **Accessibility** - Color-blind safe palette, keyboard-only controls available

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys** - Move around
- **Mouse** - Look around (click canvas first for pointer lock)
- **Q/E** - Turn left/right (keyboard-only alternative)
- **Shift** - Sprint/glide
- **1/2/3** - Switch between devices
- **Space / Left Click** - Activate device
- **R** - Restart current maze

## Development

### Testing
```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

Unit tests cover maze generation, player mechanics, device systems, and architectural integrity using Vitest with jsdom.

### Architecture
The game uses a modular event-driven architecture with:
- **Centralized Configuration** (`GameConfig.js`) for all game constants
- **State Management** (`GameState.js`) for game lifecycle
- **Event System** (`EventManager.js`) for decoupled module communication
- **Rendering Pipeline** split between raycasting (`RaycastRenderer.js`) and sprite rendering (`SpriteRenderer.js`)

### Performance
- Ray marching optimized for quality/performance balance
- Particle system capped at 200 particles
- Simplified billboards instead of complex 3D models
- Procedural maze generation typically completes under 200ms

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Requires:
- ES6 module support
- Canvas 2D rendering context
- Pointer Lock API (for mouse look)
- Performance API (for timing)
